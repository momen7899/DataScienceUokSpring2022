0,Kingtrx,1654156270143.0,stop looking at the charts.. there is no money in the market.  Fed stops pumping money to get inflation under control.. if you still want to look at a graph look at when fed started pumping money and also look at that period what that did to btc ... how hard is it to do this  to understand .. and then I have about the war in Ukraine ... don&#39;t misunderstand me I&#39;m also in btc to start selling now I don&#39;t dare .. I hope that a crazy person wants to pay more for btc in this time,,0,0

Actually we are at the bottom-line. Recession yet is not in. Its to come. Maybe in the US in year 2023 with bigger issues. FED may stop rate-hiking at the end of year. In only 2 out of 10 times Fed s actions (like actual) did not end in ressesion.,,1,0
