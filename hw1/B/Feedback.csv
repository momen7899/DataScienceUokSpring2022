11,cb cvb,"Attempted to buy 12 SOL, double charged","Attempted to buy 12 SOL, was met with a white screen saying ‚Äútransaction declined by issuer‚Äù. So I went to make the purchase again, which showed as green and completed. I then checked my crypto wallet which had 24 SOL. I have no use for that much SOL currently, so I contacted support and asked for the transaction to be reversed, since it was caused by an error in their system showing me a transaction failed. I was told SOL withdrawals are ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù. Note this was not a withdrawal, but a purchase or deposit. They refused to return the purchase. Then when I went to use the SOl, I realized that I cannot do anything with it because their SOl transactions are ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù according to the status page. Simple not true, they are not working at all. Now I have twice the SOL I wanted, and can do nothing with it. Huge let down will be going back to using coinbase.",Crypto.com,"Hello there, please send us a message via the in-app or web chat or email us at contact@crypto.com.

13,Kyle,Crypto app is not easy to navigate at‚Ä¶,"Crypto app is not easy to navigate at all, I opened an account this morning and have spent ¬£30 trying to withdraw my funds in fees however crypto.com thinks it acceptable to keep my money until they‚Äôre satisfied I can have it back.",Crypto.com,
14,Vince,The Absolute Worst,"Worst customer service experience in the crypto industry, and it's not even close. Mysteriously losing 15-20% on sales and they blame me for not taking screenshots from other sites to ""prove"" the correct currently price at time of sale. Also, their 24-hour withdrawal wait period for external wallets is a joke. In what world is 2FA and two-step verification not sufficient? Avoid at all costs and you'll be infinitely happier.",Crypto.com,

16,rodel aguila,I have a horrible first time experience‚Ä¶i‚Äôve been scammed,"I have a horrible first time experience with this platform. After a week passed, money i transferred to my crypto account remains to be unaccounted for. Customer service keeps on asking me to ask the bank to issue a transaction report of my transfer with the bsnk details snd sender‚Äôs name. According to the bank, the status of the transfer says it has been received and they already have the bank details snd name of sender. I sent them the transaction report generated by the transfer with the transaction reference number. The issue was elevated but to no avail. The bank believes i have been scammed bt crypto.com. This serves as a aarning to potential traders",Crypto.com,
